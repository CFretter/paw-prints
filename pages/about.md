## About Paw Prints in Concrete

*Paw Prints in Concrete* is a photographic archive of animal impressions in wet concrete — accidental monuments scattered across urban surfaces.

Frozen mid-stride in a material meant to last, these traces outlive the creatures that made them.

The collection invites a closer look at the overlooked — the quiet, unintentional history we share with the animals around us.
